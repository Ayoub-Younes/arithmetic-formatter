# Arithmetic Arranger Tool

## Project Overview

The Arithmetic Arranger Tool is a Python-based application designed to format and solve simple arithmetic problems. Users can input up to four problems, structured as number1 operator number2, where the operator can only be + or -. The tool checks for input errors, such as incorrect formatting, the presence of non-digit characters, and the number of problems entered.

The tool provides a neatly formatted output of the calculations, displaying each problem in a clear, organized manner. It can also show the answers to the problems if requested by the user.

This project demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Python, user input handling, and string manipulation techniques to present results in a user-friendly format.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the arithmetic arrangement and calculation logic.
Regular Expressions: Utilized for input validation, ensuring that user-provided problems follow the correct format and contain only valid characters.
Command-Line Interface: The tool is designed to run in a terminal or command prompt, providing an interactive experience for users.
